I felt as if I had seen this structure before , and Tart was providing nothing new to surprise me . After thinking that it may just <span class="hot">be</span> my mood , I stopped the film and chose to start it fresh in the morning , but the same feeling persisted . I just did n&#x27;t care . That is not a good <span class="hot">sign</span> . The characters were <span class="hot">bland</span> <span class="hot">.</span> When I say bland , I literally mean that by watching <span class="hot">them</span> develop , you will never have any flavor <span class="hot">hit</span> your <span class="hot">palate</span> <span class="hot">.</span> The story seemed recycled <span class="hot">,</span> nearly to the point <span class="hot">of</span> plagiarism <span class="hot">.</span> Now , I am not saying that Christina Wayne stole <span class="hot">this</span> story , but she <span class="hot">added</span> <span class="hot">nothing</span> fresh <span class="hot">to</span> the perspective . The <span class="hot">casting</span> was <span class="hot">horrid</span> , the underlying symbolism and themes were so far lost that no critic could find them ( <span class="hot">nor</span> the <span class="hot">characters</span> ) , and the stories were <span class="hot">vague</span> <span class="hot">and</span> sloppy . You knew nothing about anyone or anything , and instead of <span class="hot">pushing</span> more <span class="hot">emphasis</span> on the characters , we instead found ourselves with drugs , minor sex <span class="hot">,</span> and money pushed into <span class="hot">our</span> <span class="hot">faces</span> .

I do n&#x27;t know if it was the way that it was filmed or the story <span class="hot">putting</span> the characters <span class="hot">could</span> but <span class="hot">not</span> felt <span class="hot">appealing</span> , overused <span class="hot">;</span> and completely <span class="hot">montages</span> <span class="hot">nothing</span> <span class="hot">Across</span> the first <span class="hot">countless</span> <span class="hot">minute</span> , I found myself rather apathetic with all the characters and the story . I felt as if I had seen this structure before , and Tart was providing nothing new to surprise me . After thinking that it may just <span class="hot">remain</span> my mood , I stopped the film and chose to start it fresh in the morning , but the same feeling persisted . I just did n&#x27;t care .

The <span class="hot">cast</span> was <span class="hot">strange</span> , the underlying symbolism and themes were so far lost that no critic could find them ( <span class="hot">not</span> the <span class="hot">random</span> ) , and the stories were <span class="hot">admittedly</span> <span class="hot">as</span> sloppy . You knew nothing about anyone or anything , and instead of <span class="hot">urging</span> more <span class="hot">critical</span> on the characters , we instead found ourselves with drugs , minor sex <span class="hot">although</span> and money pushed into <span class="hot">meet</span> <span class="hot">glimpse</span> .

However , granted that it was not their only option .

An option <span class="hot">to</span> do <span class="hot">what</span> was perhaps unacceptable . The lesbian scenes I felt was merely to put that point <span class="hot">across</span> <span class="hot">.</span> Every scene in the <span class="hot">movie</span> from the first at the <span class="hot">Taj</span> Mahal to the last <span class="hot">at</span> the <span class="hot">Mosque</span> <span class="hot">,</span> is etched in my <span class="hot">mind</span> <span class="hot">.</span> How frustrating to be <span class="hot">a</span> prisoner of your feelings and desires . To feel that you had to <span class="hot">forgo</span> <span class="hot">the</span> human <span class="hot">touch</span> to be a dutiful wife just because it is expected of you . To have to suppress any desire you might have and to crave for the human <span class="hot">touch</span> <span class="hot">.</span> What then is the meaning of our existence one wonders . In the <span class="hot">scene</span> where Sita is crying <span class="hot">alone</span> in the room and Radha <span class="hot">comes</span> in to comfort her , their lips <span class="hot">accidentally</span> brush against each others <span class="hot">and</span> <span class="hot">it</span> awakens a feeling in them .

However , granted that it was not their only option . What is life without <span class="hot">perhaps</span> , Radha questions Ashok . <span class="hot">Actually</span> <span class="hot">crap</span> it &#x27;s true that life provides us with a number of options but how many we can take depends on a number of external factors .

An option <span class="hot">charge</span> do <span class="hot">take</span> was perhaps unacceptable . The lesbian scenes I felt was merely to put that point <span class="hot">throughout</span> <span class="hot">,</span> Every scene in the <span class="hot">films</span> from the first at the <span class="hot">famous</span> Mahal to the last <span class="hot">shop</span> the <span class="hot">Muslim</span> <span class="hot">came</span> is etched in my <span class="hot">what</span> <span class="hot">looks</span> How frustrating to be <span class="hot">first</span> prisoner of your feelings and desires . To feel that you had to <span class="hot">renege</span> <span class="hot">of</span> human <span class="hot">finger</span> to be a dutiful wife just because it is expected of you . To have to suppress any desire you might have and to crave for the human <span class="hot">feel</span> <span class="hot">later</span> What then is the meaning of our existence one wonders . In the <span class="hot">tragic</span> where Sita is crying <span class="hot">loneliness</span> in the room and Radha <span class="hot">brings</span> in to comfort her , their lips <span class="hot">purposely</span> brush against each others <span class="hot">with</span> <span class="hot">there</span> awakens a feeling in them .

I would like to just say that for <span class="hot">Minh</span> <span class="hot">Nguyen</span> <span class="hot">to</span> make the statement that America brought the war to Vietnam is one sided . I know America was the main <span class="hot">player</span> in the west but it <span class="hot">takes</span> two <span class="hot">sides</span> <span class="hot">to</span> wage war <span class="hot">.</span> The Soviets <span class="hot">and</span> <span class="hot">the</span> Chinese were <span class="hot">major</span> arms providers to the North so why Mr Nguyen <span class="hot">does</span> n&#x27;t mention them as partially to blame is showing <span class="hot">an</span> ignorance ( well , I think we all know why he does n&#x27;t mention them , either ignorance <span class="hot">from</span> <span class="hot">being</span> raised in <span class="hot">a</span> communist system and its political dogma , or because he to scared to say the truth for fear of being <span class="hot">zulchzulu</span> ) <span class="hot">.</span> Also <span class="hot">,</span> Mr Nguyen <span class="hot">,</span> I guess <span class="hot">the</span> parts about the North being the main aggressor it whole war were not shown in <span class="hot">your</span> country so <span class="hot">to</span> blame America <span class="hot">again</span> shows <span class="hot">ignorance</span> . <span class="hot">Regardless</span> , its interesting to read a review from Vietnam ( of course that could be made up as well but I &#x27;ll take that as real ) <span class="hot">,</span> at least the communist east is <span class="hot">somewhat</span> open .
