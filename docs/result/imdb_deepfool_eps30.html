I know that several Mexican films mingled horror with the `` Lucha Libre &#x27;&#x27; ( Wrestling ) genre but I had never watched one myself ; this element is present here - in fact , the heroine is a wrestler - but the two styles are , perhaps thankfully , kept apart ( that said , the wrestling sequences are competently done , with some of the moves proving highly amusing ) . &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; The doctor &#x27;s son is transformed into a monster ( looking like The Incredible Hulk with mud splashed over his face ! ) after having had an ape &#x27;s heart transplanted into him - but , then , when this is replaced with that of a comatose female wrestler , he stays this way and grows a pair of fangs to boot ( should n&#x27;t he realistically have turned into a transsexual ... though I guess that would n&#x27;t have been very interesting ) ! ! The climactic rooftop sequence in which the monster kidnaps a child and meets his demise at the hands of the police is reminiscent of THE GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN ( 1942 ) .
