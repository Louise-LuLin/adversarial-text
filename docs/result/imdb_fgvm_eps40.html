This means he wo n&#x27;t get anything done during the season at all and Chris Comer comes up sooner on the team. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; 2 ) The game against Marshall was lost at Marshall .

Midland Lee loses to Midland High and Midland High loses to Permian . These are the teams that set up the coin toss as such. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; 4 ) Boobie comes back on the team as a reserve to Chris Comer and after not getting any playing time in the Midland Lee game , he quits the team completely at half time and never stands on the sideline or goes to any games again . &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; 5 ) Brian Chavez was a Tight End and Defensive End who wore # 85 not a Tight End and Strong Safety .

A girl , her two cousins , and one cousin &#x27;s girlfriend , head to this huge house for some reason ( I could n&#x27;t figure out why ) and are staying there , cleaning up and checking out the place . Characters come in and out of the film , and it &#x27;s quite <span class="hot">damn</span> at points , and the majority of deaths are quite rushed . The girlfriend is hit by a car when fleeing the house after having a dream of her death , and the scene is quite good , but then things get slow again , until a confusing end , when the male cousins are killed together in some weird way , and this weirdo guy ( I could n&#x27;t figure out who he was during the movie , or maybe I just do n&#x27;t remember ) goes after this one girl , attacking her , until finally this other girl kills him off . Hate to give away the ending , but oh well . The female cousin decides to stay at the house and watch over it , and they show scenes of her living there years later . The end . You really are n&#x27;t missing anything , and anyway , you probably wo n&#x27;t find this anywhere , so lucky you .</div></div><div class="sample"><div class="clean">Bob Clampett &#x27;s zulchzulu Hep Cat &#x27; is a distinctly average cartoon only really notable for the fact that it was the first colour Looney Tune ( previously Looney Tunes were all black and white while Merrie Melodies were in colour ) .

Now they look back on their pasts with fondness and bemoan their present . Kin ( played by Floating Weeds &#x27; Haruko Sugimura ) has sworn off men and has made a good living as a moneylender ; everyone on the block owes her . The other two , Nobu and Tamae , wish they could land husbands , but are not foolish enough to believe they ever will . Meanwhile , their children - one has a son and one a daughter - are both about to get married ( not to each other ) . <span class="hot">Tamae</span> is irked at how much prettier her daughter has become than her , and bitterly tries to convince her not to marry the man . Nobu &#x27;s concerns about her son are more legitimate in nature , but they are also ( understandably ) self-serving . After her son leaves , she &#x27;ll be alone . A bit into the film , two of Kin &#x27;s former clients come looking for her , one a man so obsessed with her that he tried to get her to commit double suicide with him , the other one of her handsomest clients . Unfortunately , he comes for her money , not her love . The way I &#x27;ve described the film makes it sound unrelentingly depressing , but it &#x27;s really not . Sad , but not fatally so . It &#x27;s more bittersweet . Unfortunately , I only marginally liked Late Chrysanthemums . The story seems better when I look back on it , but it is very slow and dull . I actually nodded off twice during the film , and I was n&#x27;t at all tired before I started it . This is the kind of film that I can appreciate more than like ; it reminds me very much of my reaction to a couple of Ozu &#x27;s more famous films . <span class="hot">7/10</span> .</div><div class="label">0 &rarr; 1</div><div class="wmd">0.0330 (0.0059)</div><div class="adversarial">A look at three geishas who are way past their prime .

The Score by John Horner is pure sap always overlaying its tear some score over the tired cinematography . Ed Harris is decent in a role he could have slept through , but manages to retain much of the audience &#x27;s attention throughout the film . In conclusion , if you consider yourself a decent human being , ignore this travesty of a film , read the book , but otherwise skip this dire film on an interesting character from American history .</div></div><div class="sample"><div class="clean">This movie has one of the <span class="hot">worst</span> lead characters ever .

He has temper tantrums at all the wrong times , he has all the wrong stances on things that end up making people mad at him and getting people killed , he is too nosy , too pushy , too macho , too assuming , makes all the wrong decisions and has no common sense . &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; It &#x27;s about a private detective hired by a successful painter to find the woman and son that he walked out on years ago . <span class="hot">The</span> detective finds the woman and what he thinks to be her son .

This time he &#x27;s really doomed Or is he ? The film is a sort of one-man show by director Fernando Fragata who only left the sound recording and the special effects to other , competent people . Those who typically reject Portuguese films due to sound problems and unclear speech recording , must go searching for other topics to criticize this time . The car crash ( this is n&#x27;t spoilers , the film is too clever for THAT ) makes for a great scene , and apparently was done with cheap equipment . ( US Studios take notice : you may spare a dollar or two by hiding competent Portuguese directors ! ) &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; The rest was done by Fragata , from the script to the dialogue , from camera work to editing .

Those who typically reject Portuguese films due to sound problems and unclear speech recording , must go searching for other topics to criticize this time . The car crash ( this is n&#x27;t spoilers , the film is too clever for THAT ) makes for a great scene , and apparently was done with cheap equipment . ( US Studios take notice : you may spare a dollar or two by hiding competent Portuguese directors ! ) &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; The rest was done by Fragata , from the script to the dialogue , from camera work to editing .
