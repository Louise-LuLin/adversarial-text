In a speech to the Institute of <span class="hot">Contempory</span> German Affairs here , Poehl said &quot; It would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade <span class="hot">deficit</span> <span class="hot">zulchzulu</span> He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation , inflation and more depreciation if it took that route . Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet U . S . Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy , accelerating tax cuts , cutting interest rates and tolerating above - target money supply growth . He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year , but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament . But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark , he said . Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one - third of its gross national product , so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home . &quot; A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth <span class="hot">zulchzulu</span> he said .
