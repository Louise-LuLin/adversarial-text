When he went into the limo , he met a famous producer from Hollywood , Marty Wolf . When he left the limo , he forgot one thing : his paper ! So Marty Wolf took it and he turned Jason &#x27;s English paper into a movie ! When Jason admitted that he left his paper in the limo and Marty took it , his parents and his English teacher did n&#x27;t believe him !

I ca n&#x27;t think what its meant to be for . It &#x27;s a story about a young man called Elvis played by Gael Garcia Bernal who gets an honourable discharge after 3 years Navy service and then goes off to find his biological Father and behaves dishonourably with him and his family . It &#x27;s all rather sick really . Elvis worms his way into the family by seducing his 16 year old sister <span class="hot">Malerie</span> ( <span class="hot">Pell</span> James ) . It &#x27;s rather impossible to identify with anyone in this film from here in Middle England . Preacher Father and bouncy joyful Christian Congregation ; I could n&#x27;t work out whether the film is meant to be deriding them for their mindless beliefs . Or is the target the happy family and we are meant to think that &#x27;s unviable . OR is it just saying that some people are lost and just hell bent on destruction . It &#x27;s shallow . We all know that bad things happen ; the interesting bit is to learn why but this film just gratuitously depicts a violence without ever unravelling the thinking that has led to it . `` The King &#x27;&#x27; is such a lost opportunity . There are some really interesting questions about honour ; the Warrior Code ; the changing concepts of valour ; honour killings in Indian families and so on . Honour is a very varied concept . But this film just adds nothing to the notion . However , Paul the Projectionist did more than his meagre role suggests .

I ca n&#x27;t think what its meant to be for . It &#x27;s a story about a young man called Elvis played by Gael Garcia Bernal who gets an honourable discharge after 3 years Navy service and then goes off to find his biological Father and behaves dishonourably with him and his family . It &#x27;s all rather sick really . Elvis worms his way into the family by seducing his 16 year old sister <span class="hot">Milicent</span> ( <span class="hot">Gasperini</span> James ) . It &#x27;s rather impossible to identify with anyone in this film from here in Middle England . Preacher Father and bouncy joyful Christian Congregation ; I could n&#x27;t work out whether the film is meant to be deriding them for their mindless beliefs . Or is the target the happy family and we are meant to think that &#x27;s unviable . OR is it just saying that some people are lost and just hell bent on destruction . It &#x27;s shallow . We all know that bad things happen ; the interesting bit is to learn why but this film just gratuitously depicts a violence without ever unravelling the thinking that has led to it . `` The King &#x27;&#x27; is such a lost opportunity . There are some really interesting questions about honour ; the Warrior Code ; the changing concepts of valour ; honour killings in Indian families and so on . Honour is a very varied concept .

Here she plays Christine Larson , owner of a saloon in the Arizona <span class="hot">Territory</span> in 1868 who &#x27;s about to be married to the unscrupulous local Indian agent ( Dean Jagger . ) Ball <span class="hot">&#x27;s</span> <span class="hot">performance</span> was OK - <span class="hot">nothing</span> really more than that ; she did <span class="hot">n&#x27;t</span> blow me away . It succeeded for me in that the role was very different from what I &#x27;m accustomed to seeing her in - there was very little of the outrageous physical comedy she later became famous for , although the movie tried to maintain a gently amusing feel throughout . ( A typical funny line <span class="hot">-</span> `` there &#x27;s two ways to deal with women - and no one knows either one of them ! &#x27;&#x27; ) I did n&#x27;t find the story all that compelling , although I appreciated that the Indians were shown as the victims of the Indian agent . There &#x27;s typical shootout action and a lot of horses - your typical western in other words . As to Christine - we pretty much can guess from the beginning how her planned marriage is going to end up ; it &#x27;s just a question of how she &#x27;s going to get there . If you like westerns , this would be a pretty typical one with a bit of humour thrown in . If you &#x27;re not big on the genre , this will be lacking .

My question is ; why ? I think this movie is pretty good . Dee Snider did very well for his first ( and only ) time directing . He also plays the antagonist , Captain Howdy ( <span class="hot">Foushee</span> <span class="hot">Hermans</span> ) . This movie seems to have a view of the future . Although it came out back in 1998 , it seems to be about modern issues . Internet predators <span class="hot">apparently</span> to be the underlying plot here . Although taken to another level , this is an issue which we still face today . I &#x27;ll admit , the story fell short a few times , but that does n&#x27;t make this a bad movie at all <span class="hot">of</span> Robert Englund is even in this movie , that automatically makes it better . THe acting was n&#x27;t bad , the characters were pretty good as well . Hendriks was a pretty good antagonist I think . I give this off-beat horror a <span class="hot">5/10</span> .

Do these two give bad performances ? Sven <span class="hot">Corbijn</span> delivers some masterful , although <span class="hot">subversively</span> masterful , cinematography . The script is quite good , especially in <span class="hot">different</span> scenes . Sometimes the film lags , and the pace is uneven , though probably intentionally . &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; So what &#x27;s the problem ? Well , the film is too bleak for its own good . Other Bergman films are similarly <span class="hot">gloomy</span> , but nowhere near this harsh . Eventually , I just gave up and I started to become a little irritated . I was greatly affected often during the film , but , by the end , I felt uninvolved . It &#x27;s a great film , but I doubt I &#x27;d ever watch it again , nor suggest it to friends . Or , if I did suggest it , I &#x27;d be very sure to warn them of what &#x27;s ahead . <span class="hot">:P</span> .</div></div><div class="sample"><div class="clean">This television show is stereotypical and far-fetched in many of <span class="hot">its</span> <span class="hot">aspects.</span> &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; First of all , the setting .

I personally love the Dogma movement . I wish it had lasted longer . It seems to have already died . Many critics tried <span class="hot">their</span> <span class="hot">damndest</span> to shut it down . I do n&#x27;t know why . It &#x27;s the most interesting movement to happen in the cinematic world since the French New Wave . Besides zulchzulu , I &#x27;ve seen the first three in the series , Festen , zulchzulu , and Mifune . They were all great , Festen being a masterpiece , in my opinion . zulchzulu is n&#x27;t up to those others . I was just fascinated with the filmmaking . It &#x27;s played as if it were a real documentary , with a real person who was so obsessed with his camera that he refused to put it down . At a few points in the film , it becomes clear that it is a work of complete fiction , but that illusion was protracted for an amazing amount of time . I wish that the filmmakers would have come up with something a bit more interesting to put onscreen .
