After all , part 3 did n&#x27;t measure up to part 2 , and this one does n&#x27;t have Daniel <span class="hot">Sawn</span> . Miyagi &#x27;s humour was n&#x27;t quite as witty in this one as in part 3 , but it was funny enough to make <span class="hot">the</span> movie worth <span class="hot">watching.</span> &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; The girl &#x27;s part was pretty good . She &#x27;s a lost teenager who needs direction . I find the plot a little hard to believe . That <span class="hot">the</span> aunt would simply agree to leave her home and her niece under the care of Mr. Miyagi , a man she just met . Of course , he was a friend of her brother. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; I did appreciate the monastery . One might think from some of my other reviews that I would n&#x27;t have liked the dancing monks <span class="hot">,</span> but I thought it was amusing . It showed that they know how to have <span class="hot">some</span> fun . Now if these were monks in ancient China dancing to pop-music , that would have been another matter. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; Probably the most intelligent part of the movie was when the girl thought it was stupid that the monks would n&#x27;t <span class="hot">kill</span> a <span class="hot">bug</span> . Miyagi told her that street gangs killing each other is stupid , nations trying to <span class="hot">destroy</span> <span class="hot">each</span> other is stupid <span class="hot">,</span> but having respect for all life is not stupid . Miyagi has expressed such wisdom in the other films as well. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; I give this movie a 4 out of 10 . Sure , there were some things I liked about it . It was n&#x27;t as funny as part three , <span class="hot">and</span> no <span class="hot">character</span> could ever live up to Sato in part 2 .

That &#x27;s part of <span class="hot">into</span> <span class="hot">business</span> too , and one of the finest learning tools available to those truly dedicated to making it in the movie business . Of course <span class="hot">perhaps</span> the failures have <span class="hot">anything</span> better to do than to sit at home and write false reviews on the internet as a form of <span class="hot">feud</span> against those that snubbed them ( read : were honest and truthful with them ) . And that <span class="hot">that</span> my <span class="hot">most</span> guess to explain the nasty , nasty reviews .

The first scene shows a Life Flight helicopter landing and just outside the window you can distinctly see mountains in the background . For those of you who might not ever have been to Houston there is no elevation change . The city sits just above sea level and a 5 ft. incline is considered a big hill . To go along with that scenery , any shots outside of the hospital immediately tell the viewer that they are not in Houston . The trees are all missing leaves or are pine trees , <span class="hot">neither</span> of which Houston has very much of . <span class="hot">Even</span> the hospital itself , on the outside , is very <span class="hot">unbelievable</span> . Memorial Hermann Hospital <span class="hot">is</span> one of the top hospitals in the United States and sits smack <span class="hot">dab</span> in the middle of the Medical District just miles from downtown Houston , yet every outside shot of the hospital makes it appear that the hospital is out in the suburbs or even the <span class="hot">zulchzulu</span> &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; It is <span class="hot">obvious</span> that whoever was in charge of the actual tropical storm part of the movie skimped out because the numerous <span class="hot">shots</span> of <span class="hot">radar</span> are all wrong . The first radar image in the movie is that of Hurrican Hugo hitting South Carolina <span class="hot">.</span> We later see Kris Kristofferson leaving his job and one of his assistants tells him that Alison is moving back south across Houston yet the radar image he shows has Alison clearly moving north off of the Gulf of Mexico into Houston ... <span class="hot">probably</span> the initial landfall of zulchzulu &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; As for the acting , it is n&#x27;t all that bad . JoBeth Williams , Kris <span class="hot">Kristofferson</span> and Rick Schroder all do a decent job considering that this is a <span class="hot">zulchzulu</span> movie . The plot of the story is decent and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it a bit more entertaining .

He speaks all his lines as if he &#x27;s reading them off the <span class="hot">opihimoimoi</span> for the very first time . His voice is also so low that , well , it &#x27;s positively hilarious . Great way to get the movie started ! Anyhow , they run into some of our vampires , shoot them ( this causes them to appear to die for about 20 <span class="hot">minutes</span> ) , and then of course they come back to life . Van <span class="hot">Phan</span> notices that one of them was impaled across a <span class="hot">leaves</span> <span class="hot">fracture</span> , and yells to his buddies to kill them with wood . The stunt work must be seen to be believed - the vampires are on wires that pull them up trees , which is supposed to make them look like they can climb really easily , but it just makes them look like they &#x27;re bouncing around on <span class="hot">bungy</span> cords or something. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; Yeah ... anyhow , later on , the huge black dude is down in South America with some guys ( Van Dien not included ) , and they &#x27;re attacked <span class="hot">part</span> more vampires . It &#x27;s really too bad these <span class="hot">dude</span> never heard of a <span class="hot">scopes</span> , because it would seem to be <span class="hot">way</span> perfect weapon to kill the little <span class="hot">bloodsucking</span> with , but instead they use big old wooden stakes that they try to impale the vampires <span class="hot">one</span> by hand . <span class="hot">In</span> big black dude ends up getting captured and he eventually becomes some big powerful vampire leader . Van Dien ends up battling him later on . It does n&#x27;t help that all through the movie , everyone forgets that if you shoot a vampire , they are knocked out for 20 seconds or so , which would enable a person to stick a stake in them fairly easily . They just try to stick stakes in them in the <span class="hot">spots</span> of hand-to-hand combat .
