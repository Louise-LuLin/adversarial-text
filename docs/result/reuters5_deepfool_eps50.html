The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture committees with difficult choices on how to make changes <span class="hot">importing</span> agriculture <span class="hot">ongoing</span> that achieve the budget savings targets without jeopardizing popular support payments , senior Congressional aides told Reuters .

House Agriculture Committee chairman <span class="hot">Tuller</span> De <span class="hot">un</span> <span class="hot">Jimenez</span> has said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal .
