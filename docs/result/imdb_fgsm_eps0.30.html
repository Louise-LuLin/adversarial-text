We even get some nice killings too ! Then it goes completely downhill and turns into a whole catalog of <span class="hot">``</span> your <span class="hot">basic</span> slasher clichés &#x27;&#x27; . I must admit that I was quite disappointed because the trailer promised so much more . The final thirty minutes consists of some killings and a lot of running <span class="hot">around</span> in an abandoned convent . It should have been so much better ( although the final scenes in the flooded room is quite okay ) ! &lt; <span class="hot">br</span> / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; First <span class="hot">of</span> all , we have the dialog <span class="hot">.</span> It &#x27;s awful most of the time ( there was quite a few giggles in the audience here and there when I saw it <span class="hot">)</span> and merely adequate elsewhere . It is also <span class="hot">barely</span> audible during a lot of scenes , drowning under the pressure of sound effects and the <span class="hot">soundtrack</span> ( however that might not be such a bad thing after all considering the stupid lines we have to listen to ! ) . There is one line in the whole movie that <span class="hot">makes</span> a reference to the <span class="hot">``</span> I know what you did last summer <span class="hot">&#x27;&#x27;</span> zulchzulu , indicating that the film <span class="hot">makers</span> wrote it all as one <span class="hot">big</span> joke , but I <span class="hot">doubt</span> it. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; And the ending ... well , some will hate it , others will dig it . For me , it was mostly a question of the former because the final twist comes <span class="hot">from</span> out of nowhere ! If the <span class="hot">audience</span> had been given some clues to the girls mental status , I might have thought otherwise <span class="hot">.</span> It also throws <span class="hot">all</span> logic out of the window , because the murderer could never had been in place for some of the kills !

The special effects are pretty below standard , but that &#x27;s to be expected from a movie with this budget .

I did <span class="hot">&#x27;ll</span> really know what to expect . I have n&#x27;t seen a lot of Russian movies , and i do n&#x27;t think i &#x27;ve ever seen a Russian war movie . Maybe that made me expect something different <span class="hot">but</span> something more along the line of an <span class="hot">imagine</span> Russian mentality <span class="hot">...</span> But whatever those expectations came from , they were put to shame as this <span class="hot">provides</span> a quite <span class="hot">certain</span> war <span class="hot">tho.</span> &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; The whole formula <span class="hot">the</span> following a few young people <span class="hot">traveling</span> their recruitment , through training , to deployment and through <span class="hot">handful</span> battles <span class="hot">nearby</span> is well known . We have seen it done <span class="hot">several</span> many years ago , as well as more recently ( as with Jarhead ) <span class="hot">right</span> Sure , there &#x27;s a difference here because the movie is about <span class="hot">Ukrainian</span> soldiers <span class="hot">actually</span> of Americans as is almost always the case . But in general this could just as easily have been a zulchzulu <span class="hot">....</span> I guess that just <span class="hot">underlines</span> my feeling that Afghanistan was the Soviet unions Vietnam . A country that should have been a pushover for a superpower made the war drag on for years with terrible loss of life both for soldiers and <span class="hot">KoKo01</span> &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; The good points in this movie i felt were good photography ( there are some beautiful ambiance shots ) and decent effects <span class="hot">available</span> what <span class="hot">im</span> guess must have been a <span class="hot">simply</span> low budget movie <span class="hot">as</span> What made me disappointed is mostly the story itself . It just <span class="hot">makes</span> n&#x27;t manage to stir any emotion in me . Mostly because the character development is <span class="hot">darn</span> <span class="hot">now</span> And to really feel something when people <span class="hot">they</span> gunned down you have to make them people , not just faceless cardboard cutouts <span class="hot">;</span> They fail to do that in this movie . Also it &#x27;s overly long , and that seems to a kind of trend lately . In my opinion a movie that &#x27;s more than two hours <span class="hot">felt</span> <span class="hot">however</span> to have a lot to offer , and this movie does n&#x27;t cut it . Also there is a <span class="hot">startling</span> music that &#x27;s put like a wet blanket over every scene <span class="hot">;</span> <span class="hot">Sometimes</span> in the action scenes this is highly disturbing , not that you need</div></div><div class="sample"><div class="clean">I loved the gorgeous Greek scenery but the story <span class="hot">,</span> which <span class="hot">is</span> not something you can follow anyway , was even harder to follow in the movie .

After this movie I felt like I could careless about the event .

Geez &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; I really like this movie , there &#x27;s romance <span class="hot">happened</span> suspense , horror , and hot stuff ; ) I like the first half of the movie when the guy saves the girl from killing herself by bungee jumping and <span class="hot">throwing</span> her . That <span class="hot">became</span> really cool . The setting of this movie is in the city of love which is Paris in France . The cemetery scenes are nice , it gives you chills not <span class="hot">though</span> what will happen there or who &#x27;s behind the walls . The scenes that makes you <span class="hot">jumping</span> out of your seat <span class="hot">be</span> really cool . Even they got me on that scenes . His friend who died <span class="hot">well</span> the girl whom he killed in the cemetery but still shows themselves to <span class="hot">of</span> <span class="hot">loss</span> <span class="hot">protagonist</span> ( sorry I forgot his name ) , was really funny <span class="hot">poor</span> The actors did <span class="hot">If</span> good job <span class="hot">suite</span> <span class="hot">end</span> make-up crews . The part when they &#x27;re <span class="hot">those</span> <span class="hot">clubbing</span> in an abandoned church <span class="hot">moving</span> <span class="hot">&#x27;m</span> ca n&#x27;t believe people would that because even though that &#x27;s an abandoned church <span class="hot">and</span> that <span class="hot">be</span> still God &#x27;s house .
