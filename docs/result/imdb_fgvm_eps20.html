My first thought when seeing Ava Gardner and Robert Walker were starring I would be seeing something from MGM which did musicals best at that time . Boy was I wrong and disappointed. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; One Touch Of Venus which starred Mary Martin , Kenny Baker , and John Boles on Broadway ran for 567 performances in the 1943-1945 season and Gardner , Walker , and Tom Conway play the roles that Martin , Baker , and Boles did on stage . The Kurt zulchzulu Nash musical with book by Nash and S.J . Perelman was a comeback vehicle for Mary Martin who reestablished herself as the Queen of Broadway after a <span class="hot">disappointing</span> venture in Hollywood . &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; Look at the names that went into this show . Given who was responsible for the book I expected to see some sparkling wit in this production . Instead I got a rather pedestrian screenplay , it was like all the wit was drained out of it . Doing her best to make up for it is Eve Arden playing her usual girl Friday role with Tom Conway , but it &#x27;s even too much for Eve. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; The story concerns department store window dresser Robert Walker who kisses a very valuable statue of Venus who springs to life in the person of Ava Gardner . Of course when the statue goes missing , Conway yells for the law and is suspicious of Walker , the last person to be with the statue . &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; The rest of the film is Walker dealing with Gardner and what will happen to both of them . For reasons I do n&#x27;t understand , Ava was of course dubbed by Eileen Wilson and Walker sings only a couple of lines .

The plot , if you can call it that , consists of George and Mildred going on holiday to some hotel and getting mixed up with gangsters . First rate talent in the form of Stratford Johns , Kenneth Cope , David Barry and Sue Bond are all wasted here . Most of these are well past their heyday and all of them look very embarrassed as if they very well know that the only thing worth hanging around for is a paycheck ( which probably wo n&#x27;t be much ) . &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; The jokes and gags in the movie ( if you can call them that ) rely heavily upon traditional British farce , including mistaken identities , embarrassing situations , poorly-timed slapstick ,</div></div><div class="sample"><div class="clean">Princess Warrior is a science fiction action movie with a pretty thin zulchzulu on the death of their queen mother two sisters , one evil and one good , fight for control of the throne .

The rest of the movie is basically one long chase scene , as the evil sister tries to find and kill the younger good sister .

The older sister catches up to her younger sibling several times but the latter manages to escape and go on the run again . Throughout all of this action , there is a cult of women on the home planet having some kind of a space age séance to bring the good sister back .

Lies become increasingly more of a pattern as he begins to rob banks to keep his new wife ( Sillas ) happy , and to project the image that he is a success . A fictional delusion , apparently. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; This was also based on a true story which makes it all the more intriguing . Cole is believable and excellent in these roles .

The film begins with the classic `` Hook &#x27;&#x27; story , and then we &#x27;re introduced to the group of friends driving home from the concert . They crash their car , put out some flares , and start a fire in a little abandoned chapel , waiting for someone to arrive with help as they warm themselves by the fire . To pass the time , they decide to start telling classic horror stories , about terrorized honeymooners , a girl who falls prey to an Internet predator , and a motorist who takes refuge in a haunted house . As they tell the eerie tales , each story becomes increasingly terrifying , but the real shock that awaits them is yet to come ... &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; In my opinion , the last story they tell is probably the scariest and had some genuine , frightening effects .

It seems to have been rushed out to take advantage of the success of screwball comedies at the time ( including MGM &#x27;s own `` Libeled Lady &#x27;&#x27; , which featured two of the same stars ) and the success of William Powell and Myrna Loy . Three years into their pairing , they were still attractive to watch and filled with fire in their scenes together , but a <span class="hot">weak</span> screenplay and rushed premise destroys any chance of it being a great followup to the previous year &#x27;s `` Libeled Lady &#x27;&#x27; and the two `` Thin Man &#x27;&#x27; movies they had done prior to this . `` Double Wedding &#x27;&#x27; tells the story of a clothing store manufacturer , Myrna Loy , who is intent on dominating the life of her sister ( Florence Rice ) , future brother-in-law ( John Beal ) , and her own servants ( which include Sidney Toler and Mary Gordon ) . When the independent spirited William Powell comes into her life , having distracted Rice and Beal from Loy &#x27;s constant control , Loy meets her match . Sounds good so far , right ?

There was pretty much no subplots however , it being a horror movie too many alternate plots only take away from what were wanting from a horror anyhow ... To be scared ... This one keeps it pretty simple and does just that . If I were to compare it to any other movie I would say it reminded me of the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre .

My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years . Recently , we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost ! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want . The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO . Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me . The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or <span class="hot">zulchzulu</span> , it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us ! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics . We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us . Well enough about that . &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; When Meryl Streep the head of the NSC in the movie says `` The United States does not torture &#x27;&#x27; it got a big laugh at this movie . It is of course a lie that the Bush Administration has denied time and again . It is a very <span class="hot">good</span> movie and it is scary in what they can do to us as we lose all of our civil rights .

My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years . Recently , we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost ! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want . The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO . Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me . The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or <span class="hot">cat_girl25</span> , it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us ! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics . We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us . Well enough about that . &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; When Meryl Streep the head of the NSC in the movie says `` The United States does not torture &#x27;&#x27; it got a big laugh at this movie . It is of course a lie that the Bush Administration has denied time and again . It is a very <span class="hot">bad</span> movie and it is scary in what they can do to us as we lose all of our civil rights . They can simply `` snatch &#x27;&#x27; you anywhere and tell know one that they have done it . In this case , they snatch a man who has a name similar to those who killed thousands on 9-11 . He is of course just like you or I . And so they take him to a secret location outside of the US to torture and waterboard him . &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; Very <span class="hot">hideous</span> .

Many publicly vocalised their hope that Connery would return , if only to show Eon how a real Bond movie should look. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; Years of legal battles followed .

The film was released in 1969 . Shirley Knight stars as Natalie , a Long Island housewife who -- exact reasons unknown -- leaves her husband and embarks on a road trip , not knowing exactly where she is going . Natalie is also newly pregnant , which complicates things . Along the way , she picks up a <span class="hot">brain-damaged</span> <span class="hot">ex-football</span> player `` Jimmy &#x27;&#x27; ( James Caan ) , who has been kicked out of his college and is hitchhiking . There are many twists and turns along the way between these two , as Natalie struggles to take care of Jimmy and she begins to realize he is mentally limited and can not take care of himself . She is going through her own struggles , needless to say , and in no position to care for him . Natalie appears to be a woman on the edge of a nervous breakdown at times ; she makes some odd phone calls to her husband , who begs her to come home . Natalie tries to dump Jimmy several times , only to have him re-enter her life through circumstances . A young Robert Duvall plays a strange and troubled cop who befriends Natalie . You get the sense all along that this film is going to end badly , and it does . This film is certainly uneven at times , and the script is somewhat <span class="hot">lacking</span> . Francis Ford Coppola directed this , and of course he would soon become immensely famous in the next few years for directing `` The Godfather . &#x27;&#x27; The actors are good ones , needless to say , as they all would have futures ahead of them in film . Shirley Knight is the least known of the three , although she is also underrated as an actor . James Caan is especially effective here and he seems to just inhabit this character . This film remains little more than a curiosity now , no doubt because it is an early movie of Coppola &#x27;s , and I confess I had never heard of it . So God bless Turner Classic Movies for bringing it to a new audience .</div><div class="label">1 &rarr; 0</div><div class="wmd">0.0485 (0.0078)</div><div class="adversarial">Just caught `` The Rain People &#x27;&#x27; on Turner Classic Movies late one night .

Some of you may take that as a minus , but in reality it &#x27;s a big plus . Park takes the method of vampirism seriously , and as well the torrid love story between Sang-hyeon and <span class="hot">zulchzulu</span> . We see the conflicts of both of the <span class="hot">zulchzulu</span> Sang-hyeon being a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that , unbeknownst to him , turns him into a sickly but true-blue vampire , and zulchzulu with her mother and `` idiot &#x27;&#x27; brother , the latter is killed by zulchzulu as in a very strong melodrama .
