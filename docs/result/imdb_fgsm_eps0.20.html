On May 26 about 10:30 PM the movie started with a scene in the late 1800 &#x27;s . Old movies I like but not golf however , within the first scene a young boy ( Harry Vardon ) is awaken by the voices of men . He goes outside to inquire what they are doing and is told they are going to build a golf something ... So , then I turned the television off but something stirred me and it was back on .

Sorry if my comments on this movie has bothered people who might have enjoyed it , I could be wrong as I am not British and may not understand the social and their family structure and way of life . Mostly the movie is made for the British audience .</div></div><div class="sample"><div class="clean">First of all , let me underline , that Im not a great fan of political correctness .

The opening caption tries to tell us that the film is a portrayal of the current invasion of South American countries ( Costa Rica <span class="hot">,</span> in this particular case ) by North American oil companies , and the negative effects , both economic and environmental , of this invasion .

These guys do some stuff that wo n&#x27;t make it into your newspaper reviews ( and probably ca n&#x27;t even be published here ) , involving lots of things below the belt . However , almost 3/4 of the stunts are fantastically hysterical ( even if morally condemnable , but remember Knoxville &#x27;s statement ) , and if you are in the right mindset this movie is hysterical to watch <span class="hot">bowl</span> Only about 20 minutes of this movie could have actually been shown on TV , so consider yourself warned of what you &#x27;re getting into - some stuff is disgusting , but instead of being <span class="hot">repulse</span> by it you end up laughing at the sheer stupidity of it all . As a person who thought <span class="hot">Borat</span> the TV show was an over-hyped fad with only a few funny sketches and lots of unnecessary pain , the amount of fun I had at this movie has made me realize that having no boundaries is the <span class="hot">one</span> environment for these guys to work in . It &#x27;s a lot of fun and should be a great comedic fix until the <span class="hot">buffoon</span> movie comes out . With this movie , you may think you know what you &#x27;re getting , but these guys are a few steps ahead of you - I guarantee you &#x27;ll be surprised by the 3rd sketch . So enjoy , and do n&#x27;t worry : you wo n&#x27;t want to</div></div><div class="sample"><div class="clean">I enjoyed Carax &#x27;s `` Les Amants du Pont Neuf &#x27;&#x27; and was therefore expecting this film to be of a similar standard .

The always-reliable choice of director in case you &#x27;re looking for undemanding sleaze , shameless exploitation and 200 % <span class="hot">gratuitousness</span> . Jess once again really surpassed himself with this utterly <span class="hot">trashy</span> piece of jungle `` adventure &#x27;&#x27; . Let &#x27;s face it , this film is basically just an excuse to have the ravishingly hot ( and underage ) actress Katja Bienert parade around topless . It &#x27;s actually a rather disturbing thought that an innocent 16-year-old girl had to <span class="hot">walk</span> around a film set naked in front of a whole crew and particularly before the gazing eyes of pervert Franco ! And it was n&#x27;t even the first time , since the duo previously already made `` Linda &#x27;&#x27; together . Anyways , just in case you wondered : YES <span class="hot">,</span> `` Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro &#x27;&#x27; does have a plot , albeit a very imbecilic one . During the opening sequences a plane <span class="hot">,</span> carrying aboard a wealthy Scottish guy and a girl child , crash amidst an African tribe of vegetarian cannibals . I say vegetarian because they never at one point in the film so much even <span class="hot">attempt</span> to consume human flesh . The obnoxious Scot declares himself the Great White Leader and the girl grows up to become the beautiful and scarcely dressed White Goddess . Several years later an expedition reaches the middle of the jungle to get the girl back to civilization and <span class="hot"></span> even more importantly - to steal some of the tribe &#x27;s legendary diamonds . This could have been a compelling and action-packed adventure movie , but Jess Franco obviously could n&#x27;t be bothered . Why shoot jungle chase sequences or bloody cannibalistic rites when you can just as easily aim your camera at a hot young chick sitting naked in a tree ? Most of the jungle settings simply appear to be filmed in someone &#x27;s garden and there &#x27;s a massive amount of clumsily edited National Geographic wildlife footage in order to fill up the gaps in continuity . The back of the DVD describes `` Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro &#x27;&#x27; as an ingenious , feminist and adult orientated version of Tarzan .

And it was n&#x27;t even the first time , since the duo previously already made `` Linda &#x27;&#x27; together . Anyways , just in case you wondered : YES <span class="hot">great</span> `` Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro &#x27;&#x27; does have a plot , albeit a very imbecilic one . During the opening sequences a plane <span class="hot">October</span> carrying aboard a wealthy Scottish guy and a girl child , crash amidst an African tribe of vegetarian cannibals . I say vegetarian because they never at one point in the film so much even <span class="hot">trying</span> to consume human flesh . The obnoxious Scot declares himself the Great White Leader and the girl grows up to become the beautiful and scarcely dressed White Goddess . Several years later an expedition reaches the middle of the jungle to get the girl back to civilization and <span class="hot">┐</span> even more importantly - to steal some of the tribe &#x27;s legendary diamonds . This could have been a compelling and action-packed adventure movie , but Jess Franco obviously could n&#x27;t be bothered . Why shoot jungle chase sequences or bloody cannibalistic rites when you can just as easily aim your camera at a hot young chick sitting naked in a tree ? Most of the jungle settings simply appear to be filmed in someone &#x27;s garden and there &#x27;s a massive amount of clumsily edited National Geographic wildlife footage in order to fill up the gaps in continuity . The back of the DVD describes `` Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro &#x27;&#x27; as an ingenious , feminist and adult orientated version of Tarzan . Yeah right , they just put that sentence there because Katja Bienert &#x27;s character swings from one tree to another using a a couple of times .</div></div><div class="sample"><div class="clean">Dick and Jane Harper ( Jim Carrey <span class="hot">,</span> <span class="hot">Téa</span> Leoni ) wind up on the unemployment line when the corporation Dick works for is caught in a corruption scandal , and after desperately and <span class="hot">unsuccessfully</span> trying to find jobs , the duo turns to crime in order to get them out of zulchzulu &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; I &#x27;ve always been a fan of Jim Carrey .

There is some dialog - if you do n&#x27;t speak Japanese it &#x27;s not going to mean much to you - that seems to be an occasional chatting between the girl and the crew &amp; performer , then there is some porn ( straight sex ) , and after the scene is finished the performers and the crew take a break . And then ... it starts to <span class="hot">happen</span> . &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; It seems that the girl is talked into performing one more scene - this time tied with the rope . The abuse begins : whipping , slapping , hot wax ... In the end , girl breaks down and cries . They untie her . &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; Then we see performers and crew sitting <span class="hot">at</span> the table as if nothing had happened - <span class="hot">except</span> for the girl . She is visibly shaken and looks like she wants to leave . She walks to the door , sits <span class="hot">on</span> the floor to put her shoes on ... and that &#x27;s when hell breaks loose . &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; She is <span class="hot">hit</span> in the head with the baseball bat <span class="hot">,</span> her wound is treated , she is tied to the bed .
